## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed High Priority Items
- All code quality issues fixed (unused imports, undefined variables)
- CI/CD pipeline with comprehensive testing and coverage reporting
- Full Cerebro compatibility including `preload=True` and analyzers
- Comprehensive test suite with 11 cerebro compatibility tests
- Pre-commit hooks with security scanning and code quality checks

### 🔧 Minor Implementation TODOs

#### Integration Tests
- **test_broker_store_integration.py:109**: Fix feed initialization for multi-symbol orders
- **test_feed_store_integration.py:402**: Implement tick reordering or filtering in CCXTDataFeed to maintain monotonic time series

#### Unit Tests  
- **test_sub_minute_timeframes.py:67-68**: Add actual performance tests when streaming data is available and test with real exchange rate limits

### 🎯 Design Questions (Low Priority)
- Should `getvalue()` return `0.0` or raise if balances are unavailable?
- Should `_get_latest_price()` silently return 0.0 or raise when OHLCV is missing?
- How should broker behave on unknown instrument types? Log + skip? Raise?
- Should fee fetch failures kill startup, or fall back silently?

### 📝 Architecture Notes
All abstract base classes properly implemented with `NotImplementedError` for unimplemented methods:
- BaseStore properly defines abstract interface
- OHLCV subsystem has clear contracts for watching functionality

## Summary
The codebase is in excellent shape with comprehensive testing (19,200+ test lines vs 7,400 source lines). Remaining items are minor enhancements and design decisions rather than critical gaps.
